# Todo App:

# Libraries:
   *bootstrap
      Easy to use, responsive by design, re-usable components, highly customizable.
      
   *immutability-helper
      Handy library for mutating a copy of data without changing the source.
   
   *keycode-js
      Package with key code constants.
   *react
      Open-source library that is used for building user interfaces.
      
   *react-dom
      Provides DOM-specific methods that can be used at the top level of the app and as an escape hatch to get outside of the React model.
      
   *recompose
      Allows to write many smaller higher-order components and then compose those components together to get the desired component. It improves both readability and the maintainability of the code.
      
   *Node js
      Uses non-blocking, event-driven I/O to remain lightweight and efficient in the face of data-intensive real-time applications and maintains a limited thread pool to serve requests.

# Used class data structure:
Reason:
    It enabled me to do data encapsulation and write member function to `fetch()` and store it. 
    It enables functionality-extension via inheritance, the explicit tying-together of code and data via methods, and run-time polymorphism via virtual methods. 

# Ngrok:
It is a cross-platform application that enables developers to expose a local development server to the Internet with minimal effort. 
The software makes your locally-hosted web server appear to be hosted on a subdomain of ngrok.com, meaning that no public IP or domain name on the local machine is needed.

    Reasons for deployment on ngrok:
        * It is very easy to install and use(literally 3 steps!)
        * Can create tunnels to our own system using this tool, i.e can make their IP port online via this tool so that we can test out various functionality for the app running in the port
        * Fast and secure(can set passwords for access)
        * ability to track and reply to HTTP requests
